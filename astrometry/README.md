# astrometry
Astrometric mapping and fitting, and ephemeris interface

This repository is pulled out of the old _gbtools_ repository, which in turn built on adaptations of the _orbfit_ C package.
This revision will use gbutil classes, including ability to switch between TMV and EIGEN linear algebra at compile time.
